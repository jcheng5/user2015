This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r fig.height=3.5}
library(leaflet)
leaflet(quakes) %>%
  addTiles("https://{s}.tiles.mapbox.com/v3/mapbox.natural-earth-2/{z}/{x}/{y}.png") %>%
  addCircles(color = "#CC0000", weight = 2, radius = ~10^mag / 5,
    popup = ~as.character(stations))
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
